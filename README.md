# FlipperVideo
A helper to install video files on a flipper zero (Get yours now at shop.flipperzero.one)

# Converting a youtube video

To convert a youtube video to a flipper file:

run the yt2flip.py file with no arguments.

# Converting an mp4

To skip the downloading and convera an mp4 file directly, 

run helper2.py <inputfile.mp4> <outputfile.bnd>

# Transfering to flipper

When your file is done, move it to the flippers sd card into apps_data/video_player (I advise that you remove the SD card from your Flipper and connect it to your PC/laptop somehow, or wait all the night when it uploads via qFlipper.)

# Things to note

I have included the .fap file but it is reccomended to install unlshd firmware (https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware) (If installing Unlshd firmware, remember to install the extra apps version or it will not install the vieo_player)
